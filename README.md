# Prism

Prism is a provider-agnostic publishing engine for deterministic multi-channel delivery.

One publication can have several explicit variants for different languages, voices, audiences, providers, and formats. Prism validates each target before it publishes anything.

**one intent → explicit variants → deterministic delivery**

## What Prism owns

- explicit `ContentVariant` values;
- provider capabilities and preflight validation;
- deterministic target selection and dispatch;
- typed delivery outcomes and retry safety;
- provider adapters behind one stable contract;
- the versioned `prism-execution.v1` JSON/NDJSON protocol.

Prism does not own accounts, OAuth lifecycle, scheduling, persistence, client UI, infrastructure, or ai generation.

## Workspace

| Package | Owns |
| --- | --- |
| `prism-core` | Content variants, capabilities, requests, outcomes, and errors |
| `prism-provider` | Provider adapter contract and registry |
| `prism-provider-threads` | Official Threads text adapter |
| `prism-protocol` | `prism-execution.v1` envelopes and JSON Schema |
| `prism-runtime` | Stateless preflight and dispatch over JSON/NDJSON |
| `prism-testkit` | Test provider and conformance helpers |
| `xtask` | Contract generation and repository checks |

## Try it

The opt-in test provider performs no network action:

```bash
cargo run -p prism-runtime --features test-provider -- --json \
  < contracts/examples/publish.request.json
```

Without `--json`, the runtime reads and writes one NDJSON envelope per line. stdout is protocol-only; diagnostics use stderr.

## Development

```bash
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo clippy --locked --workspace --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
cargo test --locked --workspace --all-features
cargo run --locked -p xtask -- check
```

## Ecosystem

`prism-hub` is the control plane. Clients such as `prism-bot` and the planned `prism-panel` talk to the hub, not to Prism or provider APIs. Optional generation belongs to `prism-ai` and produces explicit content variants before delivery.

See [`docs/ecosystem.md`](docs/ecosystem.md) for the complete dependency direction.

## Status

Prism is pre-1.0. The deterministic execution foundation and the Threads text adapter are implemented. Live provider configuration, media publishing, the control plane, clients, persistence, and deployment are outside this repository or still planned.

Wire and crate APIs follow semantic versioning. Protocol versions are independent from binary versions.
